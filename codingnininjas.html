        <p>Don’t you just love exploring beautiful and neat sites with a clean
        user interface? While most of us would reply with an assertive ‘YES,’
        little, do we know the kind of effort and skill that goes into making 
        a website attractive and user-friendly. The secret to creating an 
        impressive site is to master the art of front-end development, and no, 
        it is not as easy as it seems!<br> <br>However, it is not impossible either.
        Here are five tips that’ll help you get better in front-end design and 
        web development.</p>

        <ol>
           
            <li><h4>Commenting</h4></li>
            
            <p>Commenting is one such practice that is often ignored by
            programmers, especially for codes that are written by multiple 
            programmers. But remember, commenting is an important part of 
            project you create. With proper comments and organised files its 
            always easier for you or others to jump in and understand where 
            things are at and how they work.</p>

            <li><h4>Invest In Productive Tools.</h4></li>

            <p>The Internet is teeming with a host of web development tools,
                from browser add-ons to smart plugins, the amount of choices 
                available now is massive! So, why not invest in some really 
                productive web tools that’ll help you improve your front-end 
                designing skills? Tools like Sublime Text, jQuery, Emmet, 
                Bootstrap, and Sass are nothing short of a godsend for web 
                developers.
                </p>

            <li><h4>Always Be Curious.</h4> </li>
            
            <p>A front-end developer has to keep himself/herself updated 
                continuously with the latest news and innovations in the field. 
                You need to take a proactive stand and learn new things about 
                front-end development from informative blogs and videos. 
                Following are some of the most informative and useful learning 
                sources for front-end developers -</p>

        <div>  
        <ui type="disc">
            <li><b>Frontend Focus</b>
            </li>
            <li><b>CSS Weekly</li>
            <li><b>Javascript Weekly</b>
            </li>
            <li><b>Web Design Weekly</b>

        <li><h4>Refactor Your Code From Time To Time.</h4></li>
        
        <p>As a developer, version control is something that you must know about.
        Version control systems let you keep track of changes made to the 
        code over time. And not just this, they also make it easy to revert 
        back to an earlier version if you screw something up. Thus using 
        verion control will save you some sleepless nights for sure. One of
        the most widely used version control systems is Git. Thus knowing 
        git has been a requirement for almost every development job these 
        days.<br><br>While these tips will surely help you become a better 
        front-end designer, in the long run, you must always remember two things
         while designing your platform – keep it simple and neat, and don’t 
         -forget to create your signature style.</p>
